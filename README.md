# Unity Mario Game

## Overview
This Unity Mario game was originally developed for **NP Open House 2025** as an interactive exhibit. The project features a classic platformer experience inspired by the iconic Mario series.

In developing the Unity Mario Game, we initially started by following a YouTube tutorial that provided a step-by-step guide to building a platformer game. The tutorial helped us get a foundational understanding of the key concepts, mechanics, and setup in Unity, such as creating a 2D environment, character animations, and implementing player controls.

However, we have since moved on to a different project for the event. This repository is now archived and no longer maintained.
